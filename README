csv2qif is a PHP script, that can take a CSV file from a online banking 
page and transform it into a QIF file which then can be imported into 
GnuCash. To do this, you need to provide the rules csv2qif works upon. 
Take the rules.php file as a set of examples and extend or change them 
to your needs.

At the moment, the PHP script expects it input from the file input.csv 
and writes to import.qif in the same directory. You may alternatively
specify a first parameter with the infile (csv2qif alternateInfile.csv),
the date will then be written to alternateInfile.csv.qif
