Gnucash-Tools from CCCMZ / CCCWI
================================

We're working with gnucash to keep track of our finances and members at CCCMZ e.V. Over time, we
started writing helper scripts, that work with gnucash's database.

We currently do the following:
- Import CSV-Data from our bank directly into the right accounts in Gnucash (csv2qif)
- Generate Spendenquittungen according to data from gnucash (spendenquittungsgenerator)
